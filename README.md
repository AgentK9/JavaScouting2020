# JavaScouting2020
JavaScouting, updated for the FTC 2020 SkyStone game! As always, featuring predictive analytics! \
Please observe gracious professionalism and credit me according to the license. 
I would also love to know if your team is using my system, so I can help you with any and all bugs. 
Please reach out to me through GitHub, or contact us via our team website [here](https://javascouts.org).  \
Thank you!
## About this system:
This is a python-driven scouting system. Data is entered through Google Forms, which goes into a Google Sheet. 
This sheet then is pulled by the script, which generates insights from the data. 
Those insights are then pushed back to the sheet for human readability.
## About Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics is basically predicting the future from past data. 
In this case, I am predicting who will win future qualification matches based on scouting data or actual match data.
# TODO:
Add elimination match Predictive Analytics \
Finish sheets integration \
Make sample form/sheet public
# NOTE:
This is under ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT! Changes will be made, etc. Nothing is safe. Trust me. 
I will accept pull requests if and only if they are helpful to the overall project.
